# GreenAI Energy Project

## Project Overview
GreenAI Energy Project focuses on predicting wind turbine active power using key environmental features like wind speed, wind direction, and theoretical power curve.  
Accurate predictions help optimize energy management, improve renewable energy efficiency, and reduce wastage.

## Project Structure

## Features & Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand distributions, correlations, and temporal patterns.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted time-based features (hour, month, day of week, weekend) from timestamps.  
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression as baseline and Random Forest Regressor for improved predictions.  
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² metrics, residual analysis, and predicted vs actual plots.
